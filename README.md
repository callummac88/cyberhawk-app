## Cyberhawk Task

<p>A Laravel app that outputs numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three prints “Coating Damage” instead of the number and for the multiples of five prints “Lightning Strike” instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five prints "Coating Damage and Lightning Strike" instead of the number.</p>

<p>The app is running on an EC2 instance with an Elastic Beanstalk environment: http://cyberhawk-env.eba-v6j3c9wc.eu-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com </p>
